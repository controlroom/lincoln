### lincoln dev mode

Care must be taken when running applications in development mode. Relying on
Docker syncing is not currently possible as it requires too many resources. We
have to rely on syncing changes ourselves. IMO this is OK because Lincoln is
made to run multiple projects, and this would probably be required even if we
did not have the blatant Docker performance issues.

### Docker Adapter

- Require definition for injection base image (ex: `ruby-dev`)
- Create project source Docker volume
- Run `rsync` container with volume attached
  - Attach ssh directory as volume
  - Ensure dev volume is mounted to `/src`
- Clone source from GitHub on first run
  - Helps with performance as first `rsync` run is often very slow
  - `docker exec {{rsync-container}} git clone git@github.com:{{github-location}}.git src`
- Sync
  - `dev_rsync_port=10873`
  - `rsync_opts="--delete --exclude=log --exclude=tmp --exclude=.git"`
  - `rsync -aqzP ${rsync_opts} ${project-path} rsync://localhost:${dev_rsync_port}/volume/.`
- Listen for changes to project source
  - Third party listen:
    - `notifyloop ${project-path} rsync -avz ${rsync_opts} ${project-path} rsync://localhost:${dev_rsync_port}/volume/`

#### Other Notes

- Affecter commands (ex: bundle install) will require mounted dev volume to work
  correctly
